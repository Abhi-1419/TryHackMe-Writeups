## üß† Overview

Ignite was a chill box. Started with some light web recon, spotted a CMS, and used a known exploit to get in. After that, a bit of digging around led me to an easy privilege escalation. Straightforward overall, but good practice. :


## üîç Recon

Started with a full port scan using nmap 

```
nmap -sV -sS -T4 -p- <IP>
```

Fuel CMS v1.4 was running on the http server and it is a preety known vulnerability which can be exploited by Remote code execution.


## üí• Exploitation


Once I confirmed the site was running Fuel CMS, I looked up known vulnerabilities and found a remote code execution (RCE) exploit for Fuel CMS version <= 1.4.1.

```
searchsploit fuel cms
```
