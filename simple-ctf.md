## üß† Overview

This was a beginner-level CTF room focused on web enumeration, SSH brute-forcing, and basic Linux privilege escalation.
Also I will be attempting all the giving questions in the room.


## 1. Recon & Enumeration

-Here I did a basic nmap scan and now we know which ports are open and what services are running on them

So now we can answer our first question

**Q1: How many services are running under port 1000?
‚û°Ô∏è 2**

**Q2: What is running on the higher port?**

for this lets scan the port number 2222

ANSWER: 
**‚û°Ô∏èssh**

## 2. Identifying Vulnerability
**Q3:What's the CVE you're using against the application?**
